# USD/EGP Exchange Rates and Historical Events
Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the impact of significant historical events on the USD/EGP exchange rate. The events include the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, interest rate adjustments following the implementation of the floating exchange rate system in 2016-2017, and various economic policy changes from 2016 to 2021. Using statistical methods and time-series analysis, the project investigates the changes in the exchange rate distribution and trends during these periods.

Research Questions
How did the distribution of USD/EGP exchange rates change around the time of the Egyptian Revolution of 2011?
How did the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 impact the price trend?
Was there a shift in the average USD/EGP exchange rate around the time of Interest Rate Adjustments Post Floating Exchange Rate Implementation (2016-2017)?
How did the implementation of the Post Floating Exchange Rate impact the price trend?
Was there a shift in the average USD/EGP exchange rate around the time of Economic Policy Changes (2016-2021)?
How did the Economic Policy Changes (2016-2021) impact the price trend?
How did the distribution of global exchange rates change during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to before and after?
How did the Global Pandemic COVID (2020-2022) impact the price trend?
Hypotheses
Null Hypothesis (H0): The historical events have no significant negative impact on the Egyptian pound.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The historical events have a significant negative impact on the Egyptian pound.
Methodology
Loading the Dataset: The dataset was downloaded and loaded into a Pandas dataframe for cleaning and exploratory analysis.
Understanding the Dataset: Each column was examined to understand its significance.
Dataset Cleaning: The dataset was cleaned by checking for and handling any null values.
Analysis and Visualization
Time Series Plot: A time series plot showing the USD/EGP Historical Exchange Rates from 1992 to 2024.
Egyptian Revolution (2011): Analysis of the distribution and price trend before, during, and after the event.
Interest Rate Adjustments Post Floating Exchange Rate Implementation (2016-2017): Examination of the distribution and price trend changes due to the event.
Economic Policy Changes (2016-2021): Analysis of how policy changes impacted the exchange rate and price trend.
Global Pandemic (2020-2022): Study of exchange rate distribution and price trend before, during, and after the pandemic.
Conclusion
The analysis reveals that significant historical events have had noticeable impacts on the USD/EGP exchange rate, resulting in heightened volatility and shifts in price trends. The findings highlight the need for robust policy frameworks and risk management strategies to ensure currency stability and market confidence.

Potential Issues
The complexity of economic systems means that the analysis may oversimplify the multitude of factors influencing exchange rate movements. Incorporating qualitative insights from economic experts or using advanced econometric models could provide a more comprehensive understanding.
